Inspired by the smash arcade hit Track and Field event Long Jump!

Given two parameters, running speed and angle of jump, draw in ASCII art the trajectory of the athlete.

Bonus points for doing sweet smoothing (e.g. using best chars depending on the angle)

Example (completely hand drawn and not accurate!)

1200 45
